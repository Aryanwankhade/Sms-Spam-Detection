Sms-Spam_Detection 

This project focuses on building a system to detect spam messages in SMS communication using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Spam messages are unwanted, irrelevant, or malicious messages sent to users, often posing privacy and security risks. The objective is to classify SMS messages as "Spam" or "Ham" (Not Spam) accurately.

Key Features of the Project Dataset Used: A labeled dataset of SMS messages is used, where each message is categorized as spam or ham. For example: Spam: "Win a $1000 gift card now! Click the link to claim." Ham: "Hey, are we meeting today for lunch?"

Techniques Used: Text Preprocessing: Tokenization Lowercasing Stopword Removal Stemming/Lemmatization Feature Extraction: Bag-of-Words (BoW) Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) Model Selection: Machine Learning models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines (SVM). Alternatively, Deep Learning models (e.g., LSTMs or Transformers) can be used for better performance.

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy Precision, Recall, and F1-Score Confusion Matrix for detailed analysis

Tools and Libraries:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: NLTK Scikit-learn Pandas NumPy Matplotlib Seaborn

Workflow:

Data Loading: Import the SMS dataset.

Data Preprocessing: Remove special characters, punctuations, and stopwords. Convert text to lowercase and apply stemming/lemmatization.

Feature Extraction:

Transform text data into numerical features using BoW or TF-IDF.

Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the model (e.g., Naive Bayes or SVM) on the training set.

Model Evaluation: Test the model on unseen data and evaluate performance using metrics.

Prediction: Allow users to input new SMS messages for real-time spam classification.

Applications: Spam Filtering: Integrate into email or SMS platforms for real-time spam detection. Security Enhancement: Protect users from phishing attempts and malicious links. Improved Communication: Ensure only relevant and important messages reach users.
